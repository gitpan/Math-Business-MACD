<h1>True Momentum, Statistics &amp; Distribution Profiles </h1>

<h2>True Momentum <a href="../chartannotate"><img
src="../banner.jpg" border="0" width="468" height="60"></a></h2>

<p>In technical analysis we are primarily interested in price,
and secondarily in volume (and close relatives like open
interest). However, we make use of many derivatives of price
(like moving averages, momentum and big name indicators derived
from these, including MACD, RSI and SSTO). There are some
indicators based on volume or volume and price, and often these
focus on discerning patterns of accumulation and distribution
(although not all accumulation/distribution indices make use of
volume). This contributions discusses the advantages of combining
volume into our indicators and illustrates some of the
possibilities. </p>

<p>Most technical analysis focuses on trends, which represent
consistent direction of price movement. Graphically, our eye
picks up consistent trend lines and channels, which correspond to
a consistent speed of advance or decline. In Physics, the term
velocity is used to denote this combination of speed and
direction, whilst momentum is defined as the product of velocity
and mass (or informally weight). In Physics, an increase in
volume results in a proportionate increase in weight. In
technical analysis too, volume is recognized as a major factor in
assessing the strength of a market. </p>

<p>Thus using the term momentum for assessment of the speed and
direction of the market irrespective of price is something of a
misnoma, so we will discuss common indicators that do not take
into account volume in terms of physical analogs like speed,
velocity and acceleration, and then look at indicators that
correspond to physical properties like momentum, force and
weight, energy, work and power. What are the underlying
characteristics of the market that correspond to these? </p>

<h2>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics </h2>

<p>Disraeli's aphorism about statistics is perhaps nowhere more
apt than in application to the financial markets. In a context of
political and financial expediency, misinformation and
manipulation, technical analysis recognizes that it is important
to focus on the truths that the market itself shows you. All
indicators have some basis in mathematics and statistics, but
averages and differences are only first order statistics. Higher
order statistics can be even more revealing. Of course, all
statistics can be misused, and technical analysis indicators and
products are no exception. </p>

<p>Bollinger bands, Black and Scholes' pricing formulae, and
Steidlmeyer's Market Profile and Distribution Theory are all
grounded in second order statistics. These thus relate more to
the physical properties of force and acceleration. In the same
way that the mass of the earth, keeps the moon circling, and the
mass of the sun and the other planets influence its orbit, the
mass of past transactions influences the various market cycles.
MACD is also a second order indicator, and reflects the forces
that cause the market to slow down and speed up - but it measures
only the acceleration and does not take mass or volume into
account. Parabolic SAR and parabolic trend lines are also second
order indicators. </p>

<p>Neural Networks and Machine Learning techniques from
Artificial Intelligence and many other Statistical optimization
techniques also tend to optimize using higher order statistics,
but as with any other indicators, different techniques and
parameterizations will give rise to totally different
predictions; and black, white and grey boxes alike are in danger
of falling into well known traps for the unwary and statistically
naive. </p>

<p>Trend lines on semi-logarithmic charts can also be viewed as
higher order, but most parabolic trend curves will NOT map into
straight lines on a semilog chart. Charting log prices is
inconvenient, not supported by all the common packages, and
precludes recognizing many trend channels, but nonetheless it is
essential to take into account the fact that it is the relative
change that is important in calculating gains and risks. So what
is the best way of doing this? </p>

<h2>Topics to be covered in subsequent parts </h2>

<h3>What are the indicators measuring?</h3>

<p>As discussed above, some indicators are measuring the speed of
the market, others give a truer idea of momentum, while certain
rare indicators measure acceleration. We will review some of the
common indicators, and introduce some new ones, in the context of
exploring the physical analogy which is implied but not correctly
captured in current terminology.</p>

<h3>Distribution Theory based on time and trades </h3>

<p>Market profile is one of the lesser known but more effective
approaches to assessing likely market action. None of the major
software packages are capable of displaying market profile, and
those that do are very limited. The factoring in of volume leads
to a much more precise tool. <a href="index.html">ChartAnnotate</a>
and CapFlow software are specialized systems for this kind of
distribution theory profile, with <a href="index.html">ChartAnnotate</a>
allowing you to see a Time, Tick or Volume Profile at the same
time as a conventional bar chart, a Point and Figure chart, and a
standard indicator. </p>

<h3>Fallacies and Facts - the best times to trade </h3>

<p>Many writers and speakers, from WD Gann to Larry Williams,
have claimed that there are particular days of the week or month
that are better than others for going long or short, or which are
more likely to be a market top or bottom. We will examine two
such claims, explain why one of them is plain wrong, and assess
whether the other is worth trading. </p>

<h3>Assessing a trading system </h3>

<p>The correct approach to testing a trading model, and the
pitfalls which lead to incorrect conclusions when this
established training methodology is not employed. Also we look at
statistical significance, which tells us what the chances are
that our nice profitable pattern is just a coincidence - it will
you how often it is likely to occur just by chance irrespective
of any underlying law of the markets. </p>

<h3>Applying Black's option pricing model to futures </h3>

<p>The statistics which are used to price options according to
the expected payoff are also useful trading the underlying
security, being closely related to Bollinger Bands. The
relationship between time and volatility is at the heart of this
approach. Index futures, since they incorporate the activity of
many traders and investors in many difference securities, are
especially appropriate for this technique. </p>

<h3>Software </h3>

<p>I am not going to be discussing any of the standard charting
software, although I have found Chart4Free and MetaStock useful,
and I understand that MarketAnalyst II 2.1 is a conventional
charting package that has a Market Profile module available. But
for maximum flexibility I prefer to roll my own, and I will
introduce the free software, Perl and GnuPlot, that gives you
more flexibility than the expensive commercial progams. I also
discuss how you can preprocess and adjust data using Perl scripts
that you then use in commercial charting software or with the
charting capabilities of a spreadsheet - I use Sun's free
StarOffice. The Unix, Linux and Mac afficionado's will be pleased
to know that none of this free software is restricted to Windows
- it originated under Unix.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>

<p>The data I use is all available for free too: from the various
internet brokers and exchanges as well as various other data
suppliers. Currently <a href="index.html">ChartAnnotate</a>
displays and annotates free 10-15 minute delayed charts - usually
charts from FutureSource are used with various indicators and
time scales being selectable from minutely to monthly bars. </p>

<h2>Reading </h2>

<p>For those new to trading, Share Trading and its sequel Trading
Tactics by Daryl Guppy are recommended as the most readable
introductions. Guppy's Trading Tactics columns in various
magazines and broker websites is also worth reading regularly,
and he publishes his own electronic newsletter. </p>

<p>Alexander Elder's book is recommended for those experienced
traders who need to develop more discipline in money management
and want to learn a bit more about all the standard indicators,
whilst John Murphy's book is recommended for its encyclopaedic
breadth in introducing all the standard and many of the more
esoteric technical analysis techniques, although it does not
penetrate very deep. </p>

<p>Finally, Dalton's book is a good introduction to Distribution
Theory and it is worth reading this, and having a general
familiarity with trading methods and technical analysis, before
trying to make sense of Steidlmeyer's own writings. </p>
